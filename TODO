MESSAGE TO MODS
Hello mods of r/autism_parenting!
First off, I just wanna say I appreciate the positivity and helpful culture of this sub and that I've learned a lot from just coming here daily.

I am a student building his senior project around a game that helps autistic children recognize emotions better. I went through the list of community rules and I know it says to not push my own agenda, so I thought I would ask the mod team for approval first.

There is no payment or anything on the project. It's a web hosted project with just an interactive demo of what the game will be.
